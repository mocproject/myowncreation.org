      <h1>MyOwnCreation.org</h1>
      <p id="subtitle">Sharing a world of creativity, one brick at a time.</p>

      <h2>What is a MOC?</h2>
      <p>
        MOC stands for My Own Creation. It is a widely used acronym throughout the LEGO&trade; community 
        to describe a LEGO&trade; creation of your own design.
      </p>

      <h2>What is this project?</h2>
      <p>
        There are currently few dedicated platforms for LEGO&trade; creators to share, collaborate, and 
        interact with other LEGO&trade; fans. The MyOwnCreation.org team has come together to remedy this 
        issue and build a new platform for the community as a whole. Whether you are an Adult Fan of Lego 
        (AFOL) or just starting out, we want to give you the chance to show the world your amazing creations!
      </p>

      <h2>Is there a platform that does this already?</h2>
      <p>
        Until recently <a href="https://thelegocarblog.com/2020/06/04/the-rise-fall-of-mocpages/">MOCpages.com</a> 
        by <a href="https://www.seankenney.com"/>Sean Kenney</a> was the largest platform dedicated solely to 
        letting LEGO&trade; fans share their own creations, outside of the official LEGO&trade; website. We want 
        to offer the community a streamlined experience that will expand upon the mission that Sean set out to 
        accomplish with MOCpages while offering a friendly and collaborative environment.
      </p>

      <h2>Where can I learn more?</h2>

      <h2>Can I help?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes! We want this to be a project built by the community for the community. The current team consists of two 
        LEGO&trade; loving data nerds learning as we go and we are open to any help you're able to offer! We could
